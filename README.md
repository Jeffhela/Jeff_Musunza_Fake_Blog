# Jeff_Musunza_Fake_Blog
HTML Blog
Hello everybody. I'm learning to code!
I've created a fake blog using only HTML. My blog is about me. I show my coding skills and learning time table.
The code contains
HTML
head, title, meta description, 
body, div, a, p, h1, ul, li, table (including thead, td, tbody, tr)
At the bottom of the page, create a fake survey form that uses the following tags:
form, select, input type="text", input type="checkbox", input type="radio", input type="submit".
Enjoy!
